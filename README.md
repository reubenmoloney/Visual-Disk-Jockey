# Visual Disk Jockey
 Visual Patterns Based on audio input

# How to use
Use vj[highest number].py (I like keeping all my old code, will be removed once it's finished though)

Once all wanted objects are added, you must close the control panel window as it make the program run really slowly (im new to threading in python)
The control panel can be reopened by pressing 'C' on your keyboard.

## Presets
Once you have some objects set up, you can save them by selecting the 'Save Preset' button, throwing in a name you like, and submitting. It will be saved as a .txt file with all of that object data so you can put that on the screen again easily.

# Packages
The following packages will need to be installed to run the code:

- pyaudio
- numpy
- pygame
- math
- multiprocessing
- scipy
- random
- pygame_gui
- keyboard

You can install them all with pip, just write `pip install [library name]` for each one in the command line.
